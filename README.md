# Obstacule-Avoidance-Reinforcmente-Learning


This project was inpirated in lukovicaleksa Master thesis (https://github.com/lukovicaleksa/autonomous-driving-turtlebot-with-reinforcement-learning), where it uses Renforcement learning for obstacule avoidance. In our case we aply obstacules avoidance in multiples robots, the robots drives though a simulated factory, which one must to get a packge in a random load place and delivery it on a random unload place. We use the ROS framework for two main activities, the first one to control the robots and get Lidars data. The second one to create a new mensage that represents each load and unload places, with the objective of warning all the robots that the place is busy for some other robot.
